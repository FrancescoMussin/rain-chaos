# rain-chaos
Despite its initial apparent simplicity, rainfall is a highly complex process and one which is core to a number of scientific disciplines, such as meteorology, hydrology, geology, and ecology [@Hu]. A proper understanding of rainfall behavior across different scales in time and space could provide valuable insights into a variety of practical issues, expecially flooding, in order to develop local bclimate adaptation planning.
