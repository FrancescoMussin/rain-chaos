Despite its initial apparent simplicity, rainfall is a highly complex process and one which is core to a number of scientific disciplines, such as meteorology, hydrology, geology, and ecology (Hu et al., 2019). A proper understanding of rainfall behavior across different scales in time and space could provide valuable insights into a variety of practical issues, such as flooding, landslide hazards, management of water resources, operation of reservoir and sewer systems, contingency insurance, lodging of crops, to name but a few, as well as local climate adaptation planning and policy-making, etc. (Brand et al., 1984, Wu et al., 2010, Gil-Alana, 2012, Jones et al., 2013, Nayak et al., 2013, Unnikrishnan and Jothiprakash, 2015, Mohammadi et al., 2020a, Mohammadi et al., 2020b).
